# Environment Setup

Environment installation could be automated by using `install-env` script. After cloning the repository onto your machine, run command:

```bash
cd <directory-of-the-cloned-repo>
chmod +x ./install-env
./install-env
```

After running the script all the necessary dependencies should be installed.

Please, review the comments in the main script to follow the idea.
